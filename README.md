# Comparing the 2022 and 2025 Federal Elections

This project builds an ETL pipeline that scrapes and processes election data from the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), combining live 2025 results with preformatted data from the 2022 election to enable meaningful comparison.

The processed data is loaded into Power BI, where an interactive report allows users to compare booth-level results geographically. Users can explore individual electorates and polling booths via a dynamic map interface.

Below is a snapshot of the report:
